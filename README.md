## What you will find here

This repository is for omgboards.com, here we will try to keep track of some customizations from css snippets, to some custom code.

It serves as a fallback backup, but also a way to share with others on the team. 

## Can you use it?

Probably not, it's mainly for omgboards.com, and we can't always share all the details. Feel free to browse around, but I don't recommend, nor support, what I share on this repository.
